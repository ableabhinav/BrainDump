STEPS TO GSOC:
1) BROWSE THROUGH ORGANIZATIONS AND THEIR PROJECTS FROM THE ARCHIVES.
2) SELECT ORG/PROJECT:	(TECH I KNOW, PROJECT IS EASY)
						* Field is interesting
						* technologies/languages I know | technologies/languages interested to learn
						* project is easy
3) CONNECT TO THOSE ORGS BY EMAIL TELL THEM:
						* Very interested in open-source dev
						* Always active on forums, reddit - Tell about those, small or big.
						* Using those OS, etc.
4) Understand their code-base.
5) Start contributing: Raise issues, solve issues, help in documentation.
6) Be in contact with them.



-------------------------------------------
Always remember:
1) You always wanted to be an active part of FOSS. 
2) Don't think of final result: Whether be selected in gsoc or not, you will learn a ton about open-source development.
3) Things are quite informal - But be clear when communicating.
4) Noob or expert just a state of mind.
