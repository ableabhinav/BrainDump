# BrainDump
A central repository of all my information. The main idea/inspiration to create this repository was to have all kinds of important information that I see or get from any source at one single place.
#### Essentially this repo would contain the following pieces of information:
* Quotes that are close to me.
* This that I always have to keep in mind.
* Tech I need to learn
* Other things I need to learn
* Misc. such as important links, write-ups, etc.
##### Possible sections/docs:
* Tech to do
* Personal
* Health 
* Imp Stuff (Important but does not go anywhere!)
